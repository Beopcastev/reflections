    logical change. Cons: We have to be appropriate to decide when to create
    a commit.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
    
    A: git log to view the commit history to see the IDs and 
    git diff to check the insertions and deletions to the code.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that

    A: By checking the git log and identifying bugs, and subsequently 
    fixing them.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
