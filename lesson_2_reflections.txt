What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A: Initializes or creates a new Git repository. I need it to build my repository
to have different versions.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

A: Staging area contains the files that are to be committed and working area contains
all the untracked files that we're working on. The commits are added to repositories 
from staging area. It offers discretion to keep track of which file is where.
